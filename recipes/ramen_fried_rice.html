    <h3>Description</h3>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>One 2.5-ounce (71g) cup instant ramen noodles, such as Cup Noodles, in flavor of your choice</li>
        <li>Boiling water</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons (45ml) canola oil or other neutral oil</li>
        <li>1 large egg, beaten</li>
        <li>1 cup (7 3/4 ounces; 220g) cooked medium- or short-grain rice</li>
        <li>Kosher salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Transfer contents of instant noodles cup (dried noodles plus all seasonings and mix-ins) to a zipper-lock bag or mixing bowl. Crush noodles well into roughly rice-size pieces, but don't obsess about it.</li>
        <li>Return crushed noodles and seasonings to cup.</li>
        <li>Add just enough boiling water to wet contents of cup but no more than that. Cover and let stand while you continue with the recipe.</li>
        <li>In a large nonstick skillet, wok, cast iron, or carbon steel pan, heat oil over high heat until shimmering. Add egg and cook, stirring, until just scrambled.</li>
        <li>Add rice and cook, stirring constantly and breaking up any small lumps, until heated through and glazed in the oil, about 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add soaked ramen along with any liquid and cook, stirring and tossing constantly, until excess moisture has cooked off and rice and noodles are lightly golden and toasted, 3 to 4 minutes. Season with salt.</li>
        <li>Transfer to a serving platter or pack into a heatproof bowl, then invert bowl on a plate to make a compact mound of rice.</li>
        <li>If a heartier meal is desired, you can whip up a 4-egg omelette; top with ketchup and anything else you want before serving.</li>
    </ol>
